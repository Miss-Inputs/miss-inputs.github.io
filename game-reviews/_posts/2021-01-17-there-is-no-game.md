Another one that I played because it is allegedly short. Yeah, it is. That’s okay. This is one of those “comedy games where you piss off the narrator” games, similar in vibes to The Stanley Parable, but this one is in the form of a pixel-arty point & click adventure of sorts. You are presented with a title screen and a narrator trying to convince you that there isn’t a game.

I do enjoy these kinds of games that allow me to use my skillset of being an experienced dickhead. That’s not something that I get to use very often. So I’m appreciative of games that let me do that and reward me with achievements, and I’ll probs buy the sequel I guess, which might last longer than half an hour. I like where they’re going with this one and I think it could be expanded into a whole adventure of the player being a dick.
