A walking adventure by the same director as the Stanley Parable? Sign me up! Even if it’s just a free thing that is expectedly short, it should be fine, right? Besides, the name is very long and it sticks out like a sore thumb in my backlog spreadsheet.

It’s… eh. I think the best way I can say this one is that you don’t annoy the narrator, the narrator annoys you instead. I kept wanting to disobey my instructions and do something else, but there’s not a lot to it other than “the narrator really wants you to press this button, so you do that”. Sure, the humour is there, but there’s no extra layer of humour from what you’re actually doing, there’s just what’s being said.

Have my expectations been warped? Most certainly. I was gonna get the achievements but then when I tried the first extra one, which was kinda annoying to begin with (collecting coins lying around to use a vending machine), it didn’t unlock, and then I looked up the Steam guides which said “it doesn’t work if you have the Steam guides open, and you have to restart the game and do it without the Steam overlay, you have to read guides on your phone”. No thanks. Basically all of them are just “hunt for all the small objects” anyway, which requires a guide… whether that’s deliberate somehow (I don’t think that’s a thing), or if it’s a weird bug, I’m not doing it. Sorry. Maybe I’m just a bit grumpy today.

To be fair this came before The Stanley Parable (I think), so maybe the concept of screwing with the game’s direction wasn’t invented yet. It almost feels like during the playtesting of this game, the developer noticed that people didn’t want to do what they were told and so made a game based around that… maybe? It wouldn’t surprise me if that was the origin story.
